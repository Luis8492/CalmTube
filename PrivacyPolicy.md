# CalmTube Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 2025-11-11_

CalmTube is a Chrome extension designed to mute and visually hide YouTube advertisements so you can stay focused on the content you choose. This privacy policy explains how the extension handles your information.

## Data Collection and Usage

- **No personal data collected.** CalmTube does not collect, store, transmit, or sell any personal information about its users.
- **No analytics or tracking.** The extension does not use analytics tools, tracking pixels, cookies, or beacons.
- **On-device processing only.** All logic for detecting and reacting to YouTube ad playback happens locally within your browser. No data is sent to external servers.

## Permissions Explained

CalmTube requests access only to the domains required for it to function:

- `https://www.youtube.com/*`
- `https://m.youtube.com/*`

These host permissions allow the extension's content script to mute audio and hide the video element during ad playback. CalmTube does not access or modify any other sites or data.

## Third-Party Sharing

CalmTube does not share any information with third parties. Because the extension does not collect or store data, there is nothing to share.

## Children's Privacy

CalmTube does not target or knowingly collect information from children. The extension is suitable for general audiences and operates entirely on-device.

## Changes to This Policy

If material changes are made to this privacy policy, the "Last updated" date above will be revised, and the updated policy will be published with the extension listing. Your continued use of CalmTube after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
