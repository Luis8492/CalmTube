# CalmTube

Stay focused — not frustrated.  
This Chrome extension doesn’t block or skip YouTube ads. It simply turns them into silence and hides the player until your video resumes.

## ✦ Concept  

**Respectful, distraction-free watching.**
YouTube keeps its ads. You keep your calm. The extension detects ad segments, mutes them, and hides the video element until the ad ends.

## ✦ Features

- **Automatic ad detection** – Listens to player state changes and instantly knows when an ad starts.
- **Ad hiding** – Temporarily removes the ad video element so you aren’t distracted by motion.
- **Ad muting** – Cuts the sound while the ad runs.
- **Automatic restoration** – Brings back the original picture and volume the moment content resumes.

## ✦ Updates

- Removed the experimental skip-button search and auto-click logic so the extension now focuses entirely on muting and hiding ads.

## ✦ Roadmap  

- **Custom overlays** – Optional imagery in place of the hidden player.
- **Subtle notifications** – Optional toast messages like “Ad break started” or “Back to content.”  
- **Lightweight settings UI** – Quick toggles for mute, overlay, and notification behavior.  

## ✦ Ethos  

This project is about *minimizing noise*, not breaking rules.  
It never blocks or skips ads - just helps you stay focused until the real content returns.
