# YouTube-Ad-Non-Skipper  

Stay focused — not frustrated.  
This Chrome extension doesn’t block or skip YouTube ads. It simply turns them into silence and darkness until your video resumes.  

## ✦ Concept  

**Respectful, distraction-free watching.**  
YouTube keeps its ads. You keep your calm. The extension detects ad segments, mutes them, and replaces the screen with a quiet black overlay.  

## ✦ Features  

- **Automatic ad detection** – Listens to player state changes and instantly knows when an ad starts.  
- **Visual blackout** – Hides the ad video completely so you just see a calm, black screen.  
- **Ad muting** – Cuts the sound while the ad runs.  
- **Automatic restoration** – Brings back the original picture and volume the moment content resumes.  

## ✦ Roadmap  

- **Custom overlays** – Show a static image or looped video instead of the black screen.  
- **Subtle notifications** – Optional toast messages like “Ad break started” or “Back to content.”  
- **Lightweight settings UI** – Quick toggles for mute, overlay, and notification behavior.  

## ✦ Ethos  

This project is about *minimizing noise*, not breaking rules.  
It never blocks or skips ads - just helps you stay focused until the real content returns.
